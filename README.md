Answer the following with as much detail as you are comfortable, and email your answers to the contact who pointed you here.

- You are free to assume any technique/technology you think relevant can be used to solve the given problem.
- State all assumptions in describing your solution

Q1: You have been given 1000 nodes to bootstrap, install hadoop/elasticsearch/cassandra (whatever distributed software you're
familiar with) and test/check. assume all 1000 nodes have been wired etc. How would you go about it?

Q2: How would you go about installing OS on these nodes ? How much time would it take ? (what if we had 10000 nodes)

Q3: How would you implement a system that distributes a file to 1000 nodes ? (Any changes if 10000 nodes ?)

Q4: How would you prevent unauthorized access to the cluster resources ? (Assume cluster service does not have intrinsic authentication / authorization built in)
